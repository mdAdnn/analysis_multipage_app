Welcome to our project, our goal is to provide accurate and personalized drug recommendations for various genes and diplotypes. Our application utilizes data downloaded from CPIC (Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium), ensuring that the recommendations are based on the latest and most reliable information.

With our app, you can easily input a text file with a person name, id, genesymbol and diplotype, which provides a proper drug recommendation. This personalized approach helps to optimize medication choices, minimize adverse drug reactions, and improve overall treatment outcomes.
