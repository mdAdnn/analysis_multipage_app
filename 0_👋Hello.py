    Understanding the genetic basis of drug response is a key step towards precision medicine.
    Pharmacogenomic drug response prediction is a machine learning task that aims to predict the response of a drug
    given the genetic profile of a patient. This web app allows you to explore the performance of different machine
    learning models on this task.
